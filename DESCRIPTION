The goal is to make it easy for beginners to start exploring a dataset through simple R function calls, as well as provide a similar interface to summary statistics and inference information. Includes functionality to generate interactive HTML-driven graphs. Used by 'iNZight', a graphical user interface providing easy exploration and visualisation of data for students of statistics, available in both desktop and online versions.
